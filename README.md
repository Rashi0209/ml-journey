This repository documents my structured journey to build explainable,
healthcare-focused machine learning models from an actuarial perspective.

## Objective

with strong emphasis on interpretability, risk control, and decision impact.

## Structure
- phase1_regression/
- phase2_tree_models/
- phase3_projects/

Each phase includes:
